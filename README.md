# Kaggle-Competition-IEEE-CIS-Fraud-Detection

This is the code solution (bronze medal) for Kaggle competition IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection.

## The Problem

This competition is a fraud detection problem where we are required to predict a probability for the *isFraud* variable for each *TransactionID* in the test set. The data comes from real-world e-commerce transactions and contains a wide range of features from device type to product features.  Additional information about the items and the stores are also provided. Dataset and detailed description can be found on the competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection
